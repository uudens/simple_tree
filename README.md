# Tree
Simple nested tree made with [Brunch](http://brunch.io) and [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com)

## View

Simply open ```public/index.html``` in a browser.  
If on Chrome, make sure it's not a ```file://``` URL because it will probably block local XHR requests. Open with your local webserver or in Firefox.  
**Double-click an item's name to edit it.**

All files for deployment on a webserver are in ```public``` folder.

## Edit

```
npm install -g brunch
npm install
bower install
npm start
```
Brunch will run it's own webserver, accessible at http://localhost:3333
Brunch will also run watcher. Simply edit and save any source file. They are in ```app/```

##Â Test

Open ```public/jasmine/SpecRunner.html``` in a browser.
